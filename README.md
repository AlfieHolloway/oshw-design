###Open-source hardware design
----------

####Introduction

This repository will contain all the hardware designs by @kennethlimcp.

Temporary project name: **One oshw project per month**

The purpose is to encourage people to **embrace openness** and get more people **interested** in hardware design/hacking.

####Source-tree

Designs here are uploaded with the following document to **minimize friction** for a beginner to get started:

- Schematic design (EAGLE CAD)

- GERBER file      (fabricate PCB immediately)

- BOM list         (widely available parts + changelog)

- PDF capture      (learn without Schematic software)

- Datasheet        (easy reference without searching)

- Appnote          (deeper learning and understanding)

- Casing           (more user-friendly and safe to hold)

####Useful writeups (by me)

- [Bringing up a new board from scratch](/Resources/bring-up.md)
- [Checking a new PCB and populating it](/Resources/pcb-checks.md)
